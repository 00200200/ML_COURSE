GREAT MOVIE. This movie should the AFIs number 1 because its so friggin' high class. The only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists. So i dont know how to get this movie, id like to buy it for dvd but i cant find it anywhere. I still have it taped from when it was first on, you can come over if you want and watch it bute i might be sleeping. this movie rocks and thats basicly all you need to know.,positive\",\n          \"Just above the box i am typing in now, i was required to pick a number between 1 and 10, and rate this feature film. Unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero, and i have to put something. If i had my choice i would just put nothing, no number, because there exist no digits that express the worthlessness of this movie.<br /><br />If you do decide to watch this film even after reading all of these horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area, this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the film.<br /><br />I don't know how this film was released to the public, it should be locked up and guarded 24/7 somewhere in Fort Knox. I am angry that this film was even available for me to watch. I feel cheated by humanity, i had no idea humans could be this cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler got nothing on this douche bag Cowell.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the movie's cover. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legit looking scarecrow on the front. 2)None of the characters on the back of case are even in the stinking movie! 3) The tag line says something about \\\"new moon, more victims\\\", there were no frigging victims no one even died. We don't know if the dam cop died, and i'm assuming the killer didn't die because it sounded like he was being hit over the head with a frigging whiffle ball bat.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours of my life. That's right four, it took an hour for me to watch it (i fast forwarded thru the 4 minute zooming scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), i stared at the television for about an hour after it was over, contemplating my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap, and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it.,negative\",\n          \"I enjoy quality crapness, and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world, or at least pre-dates our world, and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad. I quite enjoyed some of this, but the acting is so goddamn awful, and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one. I don't know who wasted more time, me watching this, or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers. I can assure you, it wont. However, on a brighter note, I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie, so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it.,negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Unnamed: 1\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" with Yvonne De Carlo), DOULE CROSSBONES (1951\",\n          \" chillingly, the Hemingway family had a history of suicides \\u2013 notably the sisters\\u2019 grandfather, celebrated author Ernest, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in 1961.\\\",negative\",\n          \" its worse than a VHS tape.

If your into movies like Citizen Kane and Casablanca id have to sugest you in a different angle. Yet i still love this movie and everything about it even if it is kind of \\\"kiddy\\\" this is one of the few movies me and my freinds have been able to keep watching over the years and quote whenever possible. GREAT MOVIE. This movie should the AFIs number 1 because its so friggin' high class. The only problem with this movie is you may have trouble seeing it because it was a made for tv movie on a channel that no longer exists. So i dont know how to get this movie, id like to buy it for dvd but i cant find it anywhere. I still have it taped from when it was first on, you can come over if you want and watch it bute i might be sleeping. this movie rocks and thats basicly all you need to know.,positive;;;;\",\n          \"Just above the box i am typing in now, i was required to pick a number between 1 and 10, and rate this feature film. Unfortunately there is no option for a number less than zero, and i have to put something. If i had my choice i would just put nothing, no number, because there exist no digits that express the worthlessness of this movie.<br /><br />If you do decide to watch this film even after reading all of these horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or blunt objects in the area, this will help prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the film.<br /><br />I don't know how this film was released to the public, it should be locked up and guarded 24/7 somewhere in Fort Knox. I am angry that this film was even available for me to watch. I feel cheated by humanity, i had no idea humans could be this cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler got nothing on this douche bag Cowell.<br /><br />Do not be fooled by the movie's cover. 1) There are no scarecrows, no one knows why there is a legit looking scarecrow on the front. 2)None of the characters on the back of case are even in the stinking movie! 3) The tag line says something about \\\"new moon, more victims\\\", there were no frigging victims no one even died. We don't know if the dam cop died, and i'm assuming the killer didn't die because it sounded like he was being hit over the head with a frigging whiffle ball bat.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours of my life. That's right four, it took an hour for me to watch it (i fast forwarded thru the 4 minute zooming scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), i stared at the television for about an hour after it was over, contemplating my life and the direction it was heading after watching this crap, and then i began to cry for the next two hours because i know someone out there will unfortunately see this movie and there is nothing i can do to stop it.,negative;;;;\",\n          \"I enjoy quality crapness, and this ranks up there with some of the finest. the cg is out of this world, or at least pre-dates our world, and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad. I quite enjoyed some of this, but the acting is so goddamn awful, and even the obligatory nude scene doesn't really have any baps out in it. just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one. I don't know who wasted more time, me watching this, or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers. I can assure you, it wont. However, on a brighter note, I have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon from this movie, so I think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it.,negative;;;;\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"review_cleaned\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 9989,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"movie recieved horrible ratings everyone voted say like movies like dude wheres car dumb dumber movie movies like citizen kane casablanca id sugest different angle yet still love movie everything even kind kiddy one movies freinds able keep watching years quote whenever possible great movie movie afis number friggin high class problem movie may trouble seeing made tv movie channel longer exists dont know get movie id like buy dvd cant find anywhere still taped first come want watch bute might sleeping movie rocks thats basicly need knowpositive\",\n          \"box typing required pick number rate feature film unfortunately option number less zero put something choice would put nothing number exist digits express worthlessness moviebr br decide watch film even reading horrible reviews make sure sharp blunt objects area help prevent trying kill middle filmbr br dont know film released public locked guarded somewhere fort knox angry film even available watch feel cheated humanity idea humans could cruel stalin saddam hitler got nothing douche bag cowellbr br fooled movies cover scarecrows one knows legit looking scarecrow front none characters back case even stinking movie tag line says something new moon victims frigging victims one even died dont know dam cop died im assuming killer didnt die sounded like hit head frigging whiffle ball batbr br favor stay away movie wasted hours life thats right four took hour watch fast forwarded thru minute zooming scenes reveal nothing plot stared television hour contemplating life direction heading watching crap began cry next two hours know someone unfortunately see movie nothing stop itnegative\",\n          \"enjoy quality crapness ranks finest cg world least predates world insanity foot bloke rat outfit chasing people laughably bad quite enjoyed acting goddamn awful even obligatory nude scene doesnt really baps complete waste time ever saw one dont know wasted time watching poor saps got dragged making faint hope launch acting careers assure wont however brighter note managed successfully degrees kevin bacon movie think almost worthwhile watching minutes itnegative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/CL/Day 4/imdb_preprocessed.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"vzhcsup2ZfRH"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"VvKsTDOoa2t6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Cmits1gkbAh7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"uhK0KFVKbAXu"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
